This Directory contains img files from my social accounts. 

I reccomend you download the files yourselves and replace them in this directory on your machine. These imgs were used to create digital signatures. 

NOTE* I create a digital signature from the bytes of these images. This means that the file I originally upload is different from the one you download.
So if I created a digital signature from my original file you would not be able to verify it because when you download that file from Instagram or Twitter etc
the bytes are slightly changed. 

So what I do is I first upload the file without a signature, download the file from Instagram or Twitter etc. Then create a digital signature from those bytes.
Create a hash from the signature with a nonce and then post that hash and nonce in the description of the post.
